*yet another redundant workflow engine*

**redun** aims to be a more expressive and efficient workflow framework, built on top of the popular Python programming language. It takes the somewhat contrarian view that writing dataflows directly is unnecessarily restrictive, and by doing so we lose abstractions we have come to rely on in most modern high-level languages (control flow, composability, recursion, high order functions, etc). redun's key insight is that workflows can be expressed as [lazy expressions](#whats-the-trick), which are then evaluated by a scheduler that performs automatic parallelization, caching, and data provenance logging.

redun's key features are:

- Workflows are defined by lazy expressions that when evaluated emit dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling complex data flows.
- Incremental computation that is reactive to both data changes as well as code changes.
- Workflow tasks can be executed on a variety of compute backend (threads, processes, AWS batch jobs, Spark jobs, etc). 
- Data changes are detected for in-memory values as well as external data sources such as files and object stores using file hashing.
- Code changes are detected by hashing individual Python functions and comparing them against historical call graph recordings.
- Past intermediate results are cached centrally and reused across workflows.
- Past call graphs can be used as a data lineage record and can be queried for debugging and auditing.

See the [original blog post](https://insitro.medium.com/when-data-science-goes-with-the-flow-insitro-introduces-redun-8b06b707a14b), [documentation](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html), [tutorial](examples/README.md), and [influences](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html#influences) for more.

*About the name:* The name "redun" is self-deprecating (there are [A LOT](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) of workflow engines), but it is also a reference to its original inspiration, the [redo](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20101214) build system.

## Install

```sh
pip install redun
```

See [developing](https://insitro.github.io/redun/developing.html) for more information on working with the code.

### Postgres backend

To use postgres as a recording backend, use

```sh
pip install redun[postgres]
```

The above assumes the following dependencies are installed:
* `pg_config` (in the `postgresql-devel` package; on ubuntu: `apt-get install libpq-dev`)
* `gcc` (on ubuntu or similar `sudo apt-get install gcc`)

## Use cases

redun's general approach to defining workflows makes it a good choice for implementing workflows for a wide-variety of use cases:

- [Bioinformatics](examples/06_bioinfo_batch/)
- [Cheminformatics](examples/aws_glue/rdkit_workflow.py)
- [Web or API data extraction](examples/scrapping/)
- [General data science](examples/word_count/)
- [And much more](examples/)

## Small taste

Here is a quick example of using redun for a familiar workflow, compiling a C program ([full example](examples/02_compile/README.md)). In general, any kind of data processing could be done within each task (e.g. reading and writing CSVs, DataFrames, databases, APIs).

```py
# make.py

import os
from typing import Dict, List

from redun import task, File


redun_namespace = "redun.examples.compile"


@task()
def compile(c_file: File) -> File:
    """
    Compile one C file into an object file.
    """
    os.system(f"gcc -c {c_file.path}")
    return File(c_file.path.replace(".c", ".o"))


@task()
def link(prog_path: str, o_files: List[File]) -> File:
    """
    Link several object files together into one program.
    """
    o_files=" ".join(o_file.path for o_file in o_files)
    os.system(f"gcc -o {prog_path} {o_files}")
    return File(prog_path)


@task()
def make_prog(prog_path: str, c_files: List[File]) -> File:
    """
    Compile one program from its source C files.
    """
    o_files = [
        compile(c_file)
        for c_file in c_files
    ]
    prog_file = link(prog_path, o_files)
    return prog_file


# Definition of programs and their source C files.
files = {
    "prog": [
        File("prog.c"),
        File("lib.c"),
    ],
    "prog2": [
        File("prog2.c"),
        File("lib.c"),
    ],
}


@task()
def make(files : Dict[str, List[File]] = files) -> List[File]:
    """
    Top-level task for compiling all the programs in the project.
    """
    progs = [
        make_prog(prog_path, c_files)
        for prog_path, c_files in files.items()
    ]
    return progs
```

Notice, that besides the `@task` decorator, the code follows typical Python conventions and is organized like a sequential program.

We can run the workflow using the `redun run` command:

```

This should have taken three C source files (`lib.c`, `prog.c`, and `prog2.c`), compiled them to three object files (`lib.o`, `prog.o`, `prog2.o`), and then linked them into two binaries (`prog` and `prog2`). Specifically, redun automatically determined the following dataflow DAG and performed the compiling and linking steps in separate threads:

Using the `redun log` command, we can see the full job tree of the most recent execution (denoted `-`):

```

Notice, redun automatically detected that `lib.c` only needed to be compiled once and that its result can be reused (a form of [common subexpression elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_subexpression_elimination)).

Using the `--file` option, we can see all files (or URLs) that were read, `r`, or written, `w`, by the workflow:

```
redun log --file

File 2b6a7ce0 2021-06-18 11:41:42 r  lib.c
File d90885ad 2021-06-18 11:41:42 rw lib.o

```

We can also look at the provenance of a single file, such as the binary `prog`:

This output shows the original `link` task source code responsible for creating the program `prog`, as well as the full derivation, denoted "upstream dataflow". See the full example for a [deeper explanation](examples/02_compile#data-provenance-for-files) of this output. To understand more about the data structure that powers these kinds of queries, see [call graphs](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html#call-graphs).

We can change one of the input files, such as `lib.c`, and rerun the workflow. Due to redun's automatic incremental compute, only the minimal tasks are rerun:

Check out the [examples](examples/) for more example workflows and features of redun. Also, see the [design notes](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html) for more information on redun's design.

## Mixed compute backends

In the above example, each task ran in its own thread. However, more generally each task can run in its own process, Docker container, [AWS Batch job](examples/05_aws_batch), or [Spark job](examples/aws_glue). With [minimal configuration](examples/05_aws_batch/.redun/redun.ini), users can lightly annotate where they would like each task to run. redun will automatically handle the data and code movement as well as backend scheduling:

```py
@task(executor="process")
def a_process_task(a):
    # This task runs in its own process.
    b = a_batch_task(a)
    c = a_spark_task(b)
    return c

@task(executor="batch", memory=4, vcpus=5)
def a_batch_task(a):
    # This task runs in its own AWS Batch job.
    # ...

@task(executor="spark")
def a_spark_task(b):
    # This task runs in its own Spark job.
    sc = get_spark_context()
    # ...
```

See the [executor documentation](https://insitro.github.io/redun/executors.html) for more.

## What's the trick?

How did redun automatically perform parallel compute, caching, and data provenance in the example above? The trick is that redun builds up an [expression graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_semantic_graph) representing the workflow and evaluates the expressions using [graph reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_reduction). For example, the workflow above went through the following evaluation process:

<img width="800" src="examples/02_compile/images/expression-graph.svg">

For a more in-depth walk-through, see the [scheduler tutorial](examples/03_scheduler).

## Why not another workflow engine?

redun focuses on making multi-domain scientific pipelines easy to develop and deploy. The automatic parallelism, caching, code, and data reactivity, as well as data provenance features, make it a great fit for such work. However, redun does not attempt to solve all possible workflow problems, so it's perfectly reasonable to supplement it with other tools. For example, while redun provides a very expressive way to define [task parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_parallelism), it does not attempt to perform the kind of fine-grain [data parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism) more commonly provided by Spark or Dask. Fortunately, redun does not perform any "dirty tricks" (e.g. complex static analysis or call stack manipulation), and so we have found it possible to safely combine redun with other frameworks (e.g. pyspark, pytorch, Dask, etc) to achieve the benefits of each tool.

Lastly, redun does not provide its own compute cluster but instead builds upon other systems that do, such as cloud provider services for batch Docker jobs or Spark jobs.

For more details on how redun compares to other related ideas, see the [influences](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html#influences) section.
